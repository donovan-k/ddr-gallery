# LinkedIn Post for Picser

## Main Post (Character-optimized for LinkedIn)

ðŸš€ Just built something that solves a MASSIVE pain point for developers worldwide!

Meet **Picser** - a FREE image hosting solution that uses GitHub + jsDelivr CDN to give you PERMANENT URLs that work forever! ðŸŒŸ

**The Problem:** ðŸ˜¤
â€¢ Imgur deletes images after inactivity
â€¢ Cloud storage is expensive & has limits
â€¢ CDN services require monthly subscriptions
â€¢ Broken image links kill your projects/docs

**My Solution:** âœ¨
âœ… Upload images to GitHub repos (free storage)
âœ… Get jsDelivr CDN URLs (99.9% uptime, global edge network)
âœ… PERMANENT URLs that survive even if repos get deleted*
âœ… 100% free, no limits, no subscriptions
âœ… Self-hostable on Cloudflare Pages/Vercel
âœ… Interactive API playground for testing

**Tech Stack:** Next.js 15, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, GitHub API, jsDelivr CDN

**Real Impact:**
ðŸ”¥ Solves image hosting for documentation sites
ðŸ”¥ Perfect for open-source project assets
ðŸ”¥ Great for blog/portfolio images
ðŸ”¥ API for automated workflows

Try it live: picser.pages.dev
GitHub: github.com/sh20raj/picser

**Why this matters:** Every developer faces the "where do I host my images?" problem. Traditional solutions are either expensive, unreliable, or have strict limits. Picser leverages existing free infrastructure (GitHub + jsDelivr) to create a bulletproof solution.

What do you think? Would this solve your image hosting headaches? ðŸ¤”
